        <h2>AM I A FIRST-GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENT?</h2>
        <div>At the University of Michigan, undergraduates and graduate students are considered first-generation college students if neither parent or guardian has completed a 4-year college or university degree.
            This definition includes students with other family members (siblings, cousins, grandparents, etc.) who have completed a four-year degree. </div>
